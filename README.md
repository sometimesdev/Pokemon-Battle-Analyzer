This is a basic app to be used at a companion to Pokemon Ultra Violet, Red, Blue, Yellow. I used the Ultra Violet guide to determine what damage multiplier each type matchup gets.
I screenshot the Ultra Violet guide and threw that into ChatGPT to create the array for me. It was wrong the first time. Secong go around seemed alright but I still haven't 100% confirmed 
the accuracy. 

The Basics:
You select or type your on hand pokemon on the left side.
Add your opponent's pokemon on the right side.
The app compares each pokemon type 1 and type 2 versus the opponent's type 1 and type 2. 
The multipliers range from 0, 0.5, 1, 2. 
It then multiplies them all together for each pokemon to create the total.
Basically >1 is good. <1 is bad. =1 is alright. 
It is important to pay attention to the type that's being compared. If you're using Mew with type "Psychic" but all the skills are "Normal" you won't benefit from the analyzer.

I quickly threw this together as I'm actively playing the game. I've included thumbnails of each of the 386 pokemon included in Ultra violet.
My data sources include pokemon through generation 6 I believe. So if it would be beneficial to include those, I will add them in.
